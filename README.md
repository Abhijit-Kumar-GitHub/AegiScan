# AegiScan â€“ Security Vulnerability Detection Framework

AegiScan is a modular and adaptive security framework designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in operating systems. It focuses on identifying threats like buffer overflows, trapdoors, and cache poisoning while providing insights and potential mitigation strategies.

## Key Features
- Real-time detection of security vulnerabilities
- Simulated attacks to test system defenses
- Threat analysis and reporting
- Automated prevention and mitigation strategies (future scope)

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
#### Core Functionality: Buffer Overflow Detection
- **Project Structure**
  - Backend: Flask/FastAPI
  - Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storing logs
  - UI: Streamlit or React.js for real-time alert visualization
- **Buffer Overflow Detection**
  - Monitor process memory usage (`psutil` in Python)
  - Detect anomalies in stack memory allocation
  - Check logs for segmentation faults
  - Generate alerts if an overflow is detected
- **Store & Visualize Logs**
  - Store security events in the database
  - Create a basic dashboard to show alerts in real-time
- **Test on Different OS**
  - Linux: `/var/log/syslog`
  - Windows: `win32evtlog`

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Add detection for **Trapdoors, Cache Poisoning, and Privilege Escalation**
- Train AI models for anomaly detection
- Implement real-time notifications
- Integrate with external security tools

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Monitoring & Logging:** `psutil`, `subprocess`, `pyinotify`, `win32evtlog`
- **Database:** MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React.js/Streamlit
- **Future AI Enhancements:** TensorFlow/PyTorch

AegiScan is designed to evolve, making it a scalable security solution for proactive vulnerability detection and mitigation.
